Supermarket Management System is created using Python to easily
manage all supermarket related functions by a single user. As a
terminal application, the users are able to perform basic operations
of their supermarket such as additional items, view items, clear
items/stocks, purchase items, search for specific products in the
stocks and edit any items/products placed in the system record.
Supermarket Management System also facilitates users to add new
products in their stocks as a sale. This function includes adding items
with their name, quantity and price of the item. Users can also see all
the items stores in the system. The program shows the number of
items along with their name, quantity, and price.
In this Python project, the users are also provided an option to
purchase items from the supermarket. The user can view items and
then purchase the items which they need

enter the product name. In order to edit an item, the user has to
enter the name, and then if the name of the items matches, the user
will be able to edit the name, quantity value, and price of that
